# React Questions Practice

A collection of React coding interview questions built for practice and learning, based on real-world problems and UI components. Each challenge is implemented using modern React (hooks, JSX, functional components).

This project is designed to help developers strengthen their React skills through hands-on exercises that simulate interview-style problems.

## ðŸ“š About the Project

These problems are adapted from the excellent blog post:

ðŸ‘‰ [50+ React Coding Interview Questions with Solutions](https://www.greatfrontend.com/blog/practice-50-react-coding-interview-questions-with-solutions)  
by **GreatFrontEnd** â€” a fantastic resource for front-end interview preparation.

This repo builds working implementations of many of those questions, along with additional enhancements and personal interpretations of certain problems.
